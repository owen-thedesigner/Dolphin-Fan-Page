                    <p>The Miami Dolphins' 17-0 season in 1972 remains one of the most remarkable feats in NFL history, a testament to the prowess of both the team and their legendary head coach, Don Shula. Under Shula’s astute leadership, the Dolphins achieved an unparalleled perfect season, becoming the only team in NFL history to win every game, including the playoffs, in a single year. The squad’s exceptional performance was driven by a balanced attack led by quarterback Bob Griese, the powerful running of Larry Csonka, and a formidable defense spearheaded by standout players like Dick Anderson and Jake Scott. This historic accomplishment not only solidified Shula’s reputation as one of the greatest coaches of all time but also set a standard of excellence that has yet to be matched in the league.</p>
